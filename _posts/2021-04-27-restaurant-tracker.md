This was a project I did that allowed for users to search for restaurants in a simple UI made using Scenebuilder. 
It allowed users to filter by Boroughs and/or Cuisines and would pull from a MongoDB Atlas database and display the ID, Name, type of Cuisine, Address, and Borough 
of selected option as well as limit how many results you get.

Utilized FXML as well as GSON to convert data pulled.


# All Results w/ Limit
