This was a project done in my college class that was coded in Eclipse using Java, JSP, HTML, and DBeaver. It utilized MVC design to develop webpages with a encrypted 
login system so users can view information pulled from a database regarding car sales, prices, and profits. Included tables to view data easily and pie charts to simplify
information. It allowed for modification to the database using SQL code using Java to directly update values in the website. Due to a hardware error some dependencies are missing and were not recovered so only the base code is there.
